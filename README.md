# My Music Analyser

## About
This repo contains the code for the My Music Analyser app. This app allows
users to look at their Spotify listening statistics anytime (top artists, track
and genres; popularity of their top artists; their most listened-to decades...).

This app is currently in dev, with additional features to follow.

## Accessing the app

Dev apps that use the Spotify API require the developer to individually authorize users before
they can log in.
